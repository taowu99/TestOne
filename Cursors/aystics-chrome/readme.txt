Author's description:

A fun set of cursors that changes in glow as it moves (on darker backgrounds). As well, the role designations are designed to smoothly flow together in seamless transitions. 

Added extra/bonus cursors for user enjoyment. Both sizes [32,48] are included.

Have fun & enjoy!

'''For optimum Glow effect/visual shimmer, I find it best to set the mouse trail & speed (in settings) to maximum, with natural backgrounds when in use; Slightly darker as a desktop.'''
